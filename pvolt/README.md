## 💡 Security Tips (Because "password" is not a good password)  

🔹 **Use a strong master password** – If your password is "12345", we need to talk.
🔹 **Don’t reuse passwords** – One leak shouldn’t sink your entire digital ship.  
🔹 **Change passwords periodically** – Like you know, but less awkward.  

## 🛠️ Installation  

1. Clone this repo:  
   ```sh

   ```
3. Run it:  
   ```sh

   ```

## Why Use This?  

Well, you know; You don't want to use any legacy software to manage your 'secrets' and stores a copy of them somewhere in the cloud so you decide to trust this random guy with his crappy scripts. Other than that:
- **Encrypted storage** – Even if someone finds your file, they’ll see gibberish.  
- **Easy to use** – No PhD in cybersecurity required.  
- **Open-source** – No shady business here.  

## Final Words  

ReadMe.md files are a real pain in the house to compose like wtf!!
Seriously though:
> *"Passwords are like toothbrushes – don’t share them, and change them regularly."* 🪥
