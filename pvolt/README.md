# PVolt Version 3.4.6 Update

## Python Password Manager - Keep Your Secrets Safe!  
Think of **PVolt** as your digital vault for storing passwords securely! No more sticky notes or "password123" for every account.
For those with higher expectation, this was created for educational purposes by someone practising cryptography and a little security. With that out of the way:

## Features  

### 1. **Add Account**  
   - Store new accounts with ease. Just provide the service name, username, and password. 

### 2. **Get Account**  
   - Retrieve a stored account in seconds. No more frantic searching!  

### 3. **List All Accounts**  
   - See all your saved accounts at once (don’t worry, passwords are hidden by default). 

### 4. **Delete Account**  
   - Removed an old account? Just specify the account then let it do the verifications and deletion for you.

### 5. **Generate New Master Password**  
   - Feeling paranoid? Reset your master password anytime.

Cool, RIGHT?!! **NO**, at least not yet until version 300.0

## Security Tips (Because "password123" is not a good password)  

- **Use a strong master password** – If your password is "12345", we need to talk.
- **Don’t reuse passwords** – One leak shouldn’t sink your entire digital ship.  
- **Change passwords periodically** – Like you know, but less awkward.  

## Installation  

1. Clone this repo:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/itsbonface/cryptography.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install cryptography
   ```
3. Run it:  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Why Use This?  

Well, you know; You don't trust any legacy software to manage your 'secrets' and stores a copy of them somewhere in the cloud so you decide to trust this random guy with his crappy scripts. Other than that:
- **Encrypted storage** – Even if someone finds your file, they’ll need .  
- **Easy to use** – No PhD in cybersecurity required.  
- **Open-source** – No shady business here. You just need to trust me.

## Final Words  

ReadMe.md files are a real pain in the house to compose like how tf will I convince someone that this is actually my kitty walking on the keyboard with certain precision?
Seriously though:

*P.S. If you forget your master password… well, let’s just hope you don’t.*
